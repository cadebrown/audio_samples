# Sm0oth_kriminal Sample Pack

These are all available to use for whatever purpose you want!

I made this sample pack from free online packs, as well as sounds I've made myself. It's mainly meant for trap & hip-hop, but a lot of the sounds are versatile and can be used in other genres as well.

If you liked this, check out some of the music I make (links at the bottom of this document).

If you used it these in a song, I'd love to hear it! Send it to my email, or DM me on Twitter or SoundCloud :)

I also like making beats, hit me up if you'd like one ;)
